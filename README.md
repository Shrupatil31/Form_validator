# Sign-Up Form Validator

  The **Sign-Up Form Validator** is a front-end web project designed to demonstrate client-side form validation using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It focuses on providing users with a secure, user-friendly, and accessible sign-up experience by validating input fields in real time and giving immediate feedback.
  The project ensures that users enter a properly formatted email address and a strong password that meets modern security standards. Each password rule is checked dynamically as the user types, with visual indicators showing which criteria are met or missing. It also includes a confirmation password field to prevent typos, a password visibility toggle for ease of use, and accessible error messages for improved usability.
  This project is ideal for beginners learning form validation, front-end developers building login/sign-up interfaces, or anyone looking to enhance their understanding of JavaScript DOM manipulation and regex-based validation.
